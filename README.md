PII Masker is an advanced open-source tool designed to protect your sensitive data by leveraging cutting-edge AI models. Built on top of DeBERTa-v3, this tool ensures high-precision detection and masking of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), making it a perfect fit for any data-sensitive workflows. Whether you're handling customer data, performing data analysis, or ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, PII Masker provides a robust, scalable solution to keep your information secure.


## Why Choose PII Masker?

When handling sensitive information, it's crucial to use tools that not only perform well but also ensure compliance and protect privacy. Here's why PII Masker stands out:

- **High Precision**: Utilizes DeBERTa-v3 for accurate detection and masking of various PII types.
- **Compliance Friendly**: Designed to help organizations meet privacy laws and regulations.
- **Flexible Integration**: Offers easy integration with existing systems through a simple Python API.


## ✨ Key Features

* 🔒 **Comprehensive Protection**: Identifies and masks multiple PII types including names, addresses, phone numbers, and more
* 🚀 **High Performance**: Powered by DeBERTa-v3 with 1024 token support for processing longer documents
* 🎯 **Precision Focused**: Advanced NLP model fine-tuned specifically for PII detection
* 📊 **Structured Output**: Get both masked text and structured PII dictionary
* 🔄 **Easy Integration**: Simple Python API for seamless integration into your workflow

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pii-masker.git
cd pii-masker
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the model:
```bash
# Option 1: Manual download
# Visit: https://huggingface.co/hydroxai/pii_model_weight
# Place files in: pii-masker/output_model/deberta3base_1024/
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Change to the `pii-masker` directory:
   ```bash
   cd pii-masker

2. Use the following code to get started:
   ```python
   from model import PIIMasker
    
   # Initialize the PIIMasker
   masker = PIIMasker()
    
   # Mask PII in your text
   text = "John Doe lives at 1234 Elm St."
   masked_text, pii_dict = masker.mask_pii(text)
    
   print(masked_text)
   # Output: "[NAME] lives at [ADDRESS]"
   ```

## 🔍 How It Works

PII Masker employs a sophisticated pipeline powered by DeBERTa-v3:

1. **Tokenization** → Smart text splitting for optimal processing
2. **Model Inference** → AI-powered PII detection
3. **Entity Recognition** → Precise identification of sensitive data
4. **Masking** → Secure replacement of PII with placeholders
5. **Data Extraction** → Structured output for further processing

## 🆕 Latest Updates
We are excited to announce a significant addition to the PII Masker project: a new model with a different approach from DeBERTa. Here are the details:

- 🌟 Model Link: hydroxai/pii_model_longtransfomer_version
- Model detail: train_pii_longtransformer.ipynb

- 🔧 Performance Improvement
This new model implementation has resulted in approximately a 4% improvement in performance compared to the previous DeBERTa-v3 model. The combination of Longformer's extended sequence length (4096 tokens) and the Bi-LSTM head enhances the sequential context understanding, making PII detection more accurate and reliable.
